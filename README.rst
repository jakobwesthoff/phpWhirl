Php Whirl
=========

What is this all about?
=======================

Whirl__ is an `esoteric programming language`__, which was invented by `Sean
Heber`__, utilizing only the characters 0 and 1 for program representation.
PHP Whirl is a whirl interpreter I wrote just for fun a long time ago using
object oriented PHP 5 code. Eventhough this is really old, I didn't want to
loose the source code, therefore I pushed it to github :).

The whole project was done just for fun, whithout any special purpose in mind.
